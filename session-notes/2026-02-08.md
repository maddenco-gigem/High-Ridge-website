# Session Notes - 2026-02-08

## Summary
Created the **High Ridge Client Hub** page (`client-portal.html`) — a centralized portal for clients to access all their financial platforms. Updated nav dropdown across all pages to route through the Client Hub instead of linking directly to external platforms.

---

## Completed

### High Ridge Client Hub Page
- Created `client-portal.html` with two sections:
  - **View Investments** (`#investments`): Orion, Fidelity, Schwab cards
  - **Access Wealth Plan** (`#wealth-plan`): eMoney card
- Each card shows the platform logo, description, and "Sign In" link
- Added portal card CSS to `styles.css` (~60 lines)
- Downloaded platform logos to `images/` (orion-logo.png, fidelity-logo.png, schwab-logo.png, emoney-logo.png)

### Nav & Footer Updates (all 8 HTML files)
- Nav dropdown renamed from "Client Portal" to "Client Hub"
- "View Investments" now links to `client-portal.html#investments`
- "Access Wealth Plan" now links to `client-portal.html#wealth-plan`
- Added "Client Hub" to footer Quick Links in all pages
- Updated `sitemap.xml` with new page entry

### Portal Redirect Overlay
- Added a full-screen redirect overlay (modeled after IHH's PracticeBetter popup) that triggers when any portal card is clicked
- Shows the High Ridge logo, "Redirecting to [Platform]" message, animated gold bouncing dots, and a "Secure Connection" shield badge
- Navy background (`rgba(15, 39, 68, 0.97)`) with gold accents to match site aesthetic
- 1.5-second delay, then opens the platform in a new tab and fades the overlay away
- CSS added to `styles.css` (~80 lines under "Portal Redirect Overlay" section)
- JS added to `js/main.js` as `initPortalRedirect()` function
- Portal cards use `data-portal-name` attribute to pass the platform name to the overlay

### Other Refinements
- Removed card titles (redundant with logos)
- Logo images wrapped in fixed-height `.portal-card-logo-wrap` containers so description text aligns across all cards
- Schwab logo uses `.portal-card-logo--square` modifier (64px, rounded corners)
- Orion card copy updated to "View all your High Ridge investments..."
- Fidelity & Schwab copy updated to "Direct access to..."
- "Call" button changed to "Text Us" (`sms:` protocol) with number auto-populated
- "Email Us" button updated to `.btn-secondary` for proper hover effect
- Wealth plan section subtitle notes service agreement requirement
- Page heading simplified to gold "Client Hub" (removed redundant "High Ridge Client Hub" h1)

### External URLs Used

| Fidelity | `https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/login/full-page` | Jay should verify |
| Schwab | `https://client.schwab.com/Login/SignOn/CustomerCenterLogin.aspx` | Jay should verify |

## How to Add a New Portal Card

### Step 1: Get the logo image
- Download the platform's official logo (PNG preferred, ~400px wide)
- Save to `images/` with naming convention: `platformname-logo.png`
- Verify it's a real image: `file images/platformname-logo.png`

### Step 2: Add the card HTML
Open `client-portal.html` and add a new card inside the appropriate section's grid/container:

- **Investment platform** → Add inside the `<div class="grid grid-3">` in the `#investments` section
- **Planning/wealth tool** → Add inside the `<div>` wrapper in the `#wealth-plan` section

Card template:
```html
<!-- Platform Name -->
<a href="https://platform-login-url.com/" class="card portal-card" data-portal-name="Platform Name" aria-label="Sign in to Platform Name (opens in new tab)">
  <div class="portal-card-logo-wrap">
    <img src="images/platformname-logo.png" alt="Platform Name" class="portal-card-logo">
  </div>
  <p>Brief description of what the client uses this platform for.</p>
  <span class="portal-card-action">
    Sign In
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M7 7h10v10"/><path d="M7 17 17 7"/></svg>
  </span>
</a>
```

**Important:** The `data-portal-name` attribute is required — it powers the redirect overlay ("Redirecting to Platform Name"). Without it, the card will navigate directly without the overlay.

### Step 3: Adjust the grid (if needed)
- The investments section uses `grid grid-3` (3 columns). If adding a 4th card, change to `grid grid-4` or keep `grid-3` (the 4th card wraps to a new row).
- The wealth plan section currently has a single centered card (`max-width: 380px; margin: 0 auto`). If adding a second card, replace the wrapper div with `<div class="grid grid-2" ...>` or `<div class="grid grid-3" ...>`.

### Step 4: No other files need changes
The nav dropdown, footer links, CSS, and sitemap are already set up. New cards within the existing sections require only editing `client-portal.html`.

### CSS classes reference
| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `.card.portal-card` | Full-card clickable link with gold top border and hover effects |
| `.portal-card-logo-wrap` | Fixed-height (64px) container that vertically centers logos so descriptions align |
| `.portal-card-logo` | Logo image (48px height, max 160px width, object-fit contain) |
| `.portal-card-logo--square` | Modifier for square logos like Schwab (64px, rounded corners) |
| `.portal-card-action` | "Sign In" text with arrow icon at bottom of card |
| `data-portal-name` | HTML attribute on `<a>` tag — triggers redirect overlay with platform name |
